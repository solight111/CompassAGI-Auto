# Experiment 03: Hardened Core Complex Build Test

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Duration:** ~7 minutes (all 14 phases)
**Model:** OpenAI gpt-4.1-mini, temperature 0.0
**Orchestrator max_iterations:** 20
**Core version:** Post-Experiment 01 hardened (file routing, plan decomposition, task dedup, startup recovery)

---

## Objective

Re-run the same mega-prompt from Experiment 01 against the hardened core to measure improvement. Key fixes applied since Exp 01: file type routing, plan-based decomposition for complex prompts, task dedup cache, approval persistence, startup state recovery, self-improver disabled.

## The Prompt

Same as Experiment 01 (6 subsystems: Sandbox Garage, Scoring, GitHub, Fly.io, React Native, Launcher).

## Prior Attempts

- **Experiment 01:** No planning, single-pass build, server crash from JSX-in-.py, 7 files created with 12 bugs
- **Experiment 02:** Planning triggered but regex mismatch (`\d+\.\s*` vs `Description:` format) — zero phases executed, zero output
- **Experiment 03a (aborted):** Fixed regex, self-improver still enabled — completed Phase 1, locked up during Phase 2 when self-improver ran concurrently
- **Experiment 03b (this run):** Self-improver disabled, clean run through all 14 phases

## What Auto Generated

### Planner Output: 14 Phases

The `_is_complex_prompt()` detector correctly identified the mega-prompt (100+ words, multiple subsystems). PlannerAgent decomposed it into 14 sequential phases with dependencies.

## Bugs Found

### Bug #15: Plan Parsing Regex Mismatch (Fixed mid-experiment)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Description:** Planner outputs `Step N\nDescription: ...` format but orchestrator parsed with `r"\d+\.\s*(.+)"` expecting `N. ...` format. Extracted garbage ("Responsible agent: Builder") instead of step descriptions.
- **Impact:** Experiment 02 produced zero output despite successful planning.
- **Fix applied:** Changed regex to `r"Description:\s*(.+)"` with fallback to old format.

### Bug #16: Self-Improver Causes Concurrent LLM Lockup
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** Even as `asyncio.create_task()`, self-improver hitting OpenAI API concurrently with active phase execution causes lockups. Both tasks compete for the same LLM endpoint. Experiment 03a died on Phase 2 with self-improver running alongside.
- **Impact:** Server becomes unresponsive, build phases stall.
- **Fix applied:** Disabled self-improver entirely. Needs architectural rethink (queue-based, run only between phases, not during).

### Bug #17: Auto Re-enables Disabled Code
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Auto re-enabled the self-improver call we disabled AND added a new `monitor_and_improve()` infinite loop method with blocking `await self_improver.improve()`. Auto actively works against our safety fixes.
- **Impact:** Had to re-disable after Auto's modifications.
- **Fix needed:** FileGuardian pattern matching or code review step.

### Bug #18: `nul` File Keeps Reappearing
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Despite `run_command` sanitization for `> nul` redirects, the `nul` file keeps being created. Likely coming through a different code path (possibly `write_file` or direct subprocess calls in agents).
- **Impact:** Blocks git operations on Windows.
- **Fix needed:** Trace exact creation path, add `nul` check to all file write paths.

### Bug #19: Duplicate Scoring Agent
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Description:** Auto created `scoring_system.py` (new, AST-based) alongside existing `scoring_agent.py` (ruff+bandit). Two scoring implementations, neither aware of the other.
- **Impact:** Confusion about which scorer is canonical.

### Bug #20: Phase 12 Hit Max Iterations
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Description:** Validation phase (comprehensive testing) hit the 20-iteration ceiling. Returned "Agent stopped due to max iterations" with no test results.
- **Impact:** Validation phase produced no useful output.

### Bug #21: react_native_app.py Still in backend/agents/
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Description:** The React Native app was rewritten (91→228 lines) but still lives at `backend/agents/react_native_app.py` — a JSX component in a Python directory. File type routing didn't block because the file already existed.
- **Impact:** Still in wrong location, still crashes uvicorn if reload parses it.

|--------|--------|--------|
| Planning phase | None | 14-phase plan with dependencies |
| Phases executed | 1 (monolithic) | 14/14 |
| Duration | ~25 min (with crash) | ~7 min |

## What Worked Well

| # | Finding |
|---|---------|
| 1 | **Planning decomposition worked** — 14 phases, all executed sequentially |
| 2 | **No crashes** — server stayed up throughout |
| 3 | **No hangs** (with self-improver disabled) |
| 4 | **7 minutes total** — faster than Exp 01's 25 min with better output |
| 5 | **Real implementations** — scoring_system.py uses AST, sandbox_garage.py uses Docker |
| 6 | **Tests generated** — first time Auto produced test files |
| 7 | **Improved existing files** — github_agent got auto-versioning, flyio_agent got proper async |
| 8 | **File routing held** — no new files placed in wrong directories |
| 9 | **Task dedup working** — cache entries present, no duplicate processing |
| 10 | **Startup recovery working** — stale "running" steps properly marked "interrupted" |

## Key Insight: The Self-Improver Problem

The self-improver has been the #1 source of instability across all experiments:
- **Exp 01:** Blocking `await` caused server hangs
- **Exp 02:** Throttle prevented it from running (accidentally helpful)
- **Exp 03a:** `asyncio.create_task()` still caused lockup via concurrent LLM calls
- **Exp 03b:** Disabled entirely — first clean run

The root cause isn't blocking vs non-blocking. It's **concurrent LLM access**. When the self-improver hits OpenAI while another agent is mid-execution, something breaks (likely rate limiting or context/token exhaustion on gpt-4.1-mini).

**Proposed fix for v2:** Queue-based execution. Self-improver should only run after ALL phases complete, not after each individual phase. Or: use a semaphore to ensure only one LLM call happens at a time.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (for next experiment)
1. **LLM semaphore** — single concurrent call at a time
2. **Self-improver as post-build hook** — runs once after all phases, not per-phase
3. **Trace `nul` file origin** — add logging to all file write paths

### Short-term
4. **Consolidate scoring agents** — merge scoring_system.py and scoring_agent.py
5. **Move react_native_app** — relocate to `mobile/` or `frontend/`
6. **Max iterations handling** — save partial work on Phase 12-type failures

### Architectural
7. **Agent execution queue** — serialize all LLM calls through a single queue
8. **Real-time monitoring** — Prometheus metrics + WebSocket activity feed
9. **Code review gate** — prevent Auto from re-enabling disabled code

## Experiment 03c: Post-Hardening Validation (2026-02-09)

### What We Did

Continued from 03b with focus on Auto self-diagnosing and fixing its own issues.

### Phase 1: NUL Ghost Bug Hunt
- Gave Auto the task of finding and fixing the NUL file problem itself
- Auto added empty content guard to `builder.py` `write_file()`: rejects empty/null writes with ValueError
- Submitted fix through FileGuardian approval correctly

### Phase 2: Stub Overwrite Attempts
- Auto proposed rewrites of `planner.py`, `config.py`, `llm.py` — all inferior stubs
- All three denied manually. Existing implementations are superior
- Confirms need for pre-write check against existing files

### Phase 3: Self-Awareness Test
- Asked Auto to analyze its own codebase
- Produced accurate summary of all agents, tools, state, API, frontend
- Concluded it is "self-aware and capable of analyzing its own state"

### Phase 4: Self-Validation
- Auto read all test files, found mismatches between tests and actual APIs
- Hit max_iterations (20) on first pass, resumed and completed when prompted
- Fixed all test files: sync→async, wrong method names, wrong signatures, proper exceptions
- Updated toolsmith.py to match new test expectations

### Phase 5: Researcher Upgrade
- Added Python, Node.js, React Native, Fly.io, GitHub to DOC_SITES
- Built `research_before_build()` method and wired into build loop
- Planner repeatedly hit max recursion depth during decomposition — known issue
- State cache shows extensive over-decomposition traces

### Phase 6: Deployment Prep
- Auto created Dockerfile, fly.toml, settings.py, FLYIO.md
- Missed requirements.txt initially — fixed immediately when told
- Generated deployment docs and automation scripts

### Phase 7: File Migration
- `backend/agents/react_native_app.py` moved to `frontend/components/ReactNativeChatApp.tsx`
- Correct extension, correct directory

### Issues Resolved from Exp 01/03b
| Bug | Status |
|-----|--------|
| #2 JSX as .py | Fixed — moved to .tsx |
| #3 Wrong directory | Fixed — now in frontend/components/ |
| #6 Dead import | Fixed — self_improver_tools removed from tools/__init__ |
| #18 NUL ghost | Mitigated — empty content guard in builder |
| #21 react_native_app location | Fixed — migrated |

### New Observations
| # | Finding |
|---|---------|
| 1 | Auto is functionally self-aware — reads, analyzes, modifies its own code |
| 2 | Self-correction works — fixes quickly when told what it missed |
| 3 | Planner is the bottleneck, not the builder |
| 4 | Scoped explicit prompts get good results; vague multi-part requests get shallow treatment |
| 5 | Auto went to fix the planner on its own after we observed the decomposition issue |

### Ready for Experiment 04
- Fly.io deployment files in place
- Test suite aligned to actual APIs
- Researcher wired into build loop
- Next: Deploy to Fly.io, test Auto-Pool provisioner concept
